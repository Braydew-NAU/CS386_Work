# 1. Activity Summary 
## Mitchelle:
-  Mitchelle did his commits to the use cases. These use cases were based off part one and two of the deliverables. Each use case goes into great detail of each of the 3 users and how they interact with the website.
## Diego A
- Diego added a few user stories to the repository. Each of the users were different customers who will use our website. Each user story is just how we did in class and they lead into the issues for our deliverables. We didn't have any serious issues as of now but we are running into some as we go and they are in the issues tab.   
## Braydon
- Braydon did his commits to the positioning. He added a problem statement, product position statement, and Value Proposition and Customer Segment each with their own description.
## Diego D
- Diego did his commits to the stakeholders and added the MVP to our deliverables. Diego did a great amount of work on the stakeholders and their roles in the deliverable report. He also added the summary of our MVP.  
## Tyler
-  Tlyer did his commits to functional and nonfunctional requirements. He added 3 and 6 requirements for the functional and nonfuncitonal respectively. Each goes into depth about what needs to be done. 
 


# 2. Retrospective

## 1. Appreciations: <small>Braydon did a good job on making sure everyone was doing their individual piece. He made sure we each had about equal work spread out for all.</small>
## 2. Successes: <small>We got our Github fully up to date and ready to go for the progression of the project. We all know how to do our jobs and push the commits. </small>
## 3. Failures: <small>There isn't thing this week that we think could be considered as a falure except for some small hiccups here and there but nothing major. </small>
## 4. Barriers:<small> This week we each had some issues with branching and getting a feel for the Github repo. We had issues pushing the commits, making the commits, and navigating Github. </small>
## 5. What we should try next time:<small> Now that we are all comfortable with our skills on Github, we can make more progress for the website. We will try to do things on our own and be comfortable with making  pushes and issues and being able to rely on the other group members to take care of their parts.  </small>

# 3. Next Steps

## Mitchelle:
- Mitchelle will continue to add to the use cases as we go through more testing and brainstorming of the project. He will see the views of everyone from the outside as much as possible. 
## Diego A
- Diego will continue to commit any issues that the group encounter and start to work on fixingf them given the priority of the issue. He will also come up with other user stories to add to the project progress.  
## Braydon
-  Braydon will work on deliverable 3 and make sure we are each doing our part on it. He is the manager for this report and is making sure we each contribute as equally as we possibly can. 
## Diego D
- Diego will make sure we implement the MVP to our website and that we follow it until the end. He will also continue to add to the stakeholders section as we progress. 
## Tyler
- Tyler will continue his commits to the functional and nonfunctional requirements. Seeing if we need anymore and to potentially start writing psuedocode for it.
