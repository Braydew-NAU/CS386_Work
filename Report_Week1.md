# 3. Meeting Schedule
## <small>We plan to meet every Thursday after class. This will give us enough time to refresh on what needs to be done after lecture.</small>

# 4. Communication Plan
## <small>We have decided to communicate through Discord to talk about project related issues. If it is urgent we will text each other on phone numbers. We also decided that since there is 5 of us a 3 out of 5 will decide design choices. If it a split between 2 and 2 and the other person can't decide, we will flip a coin for the choice since this will allow us to move along quicker.</small>

# 5. Project Idea
## <small>We discussed the project and landed on a one stop shop sports website. This site will have most sport information such as start times, what channels, previous scores, ect. We will most likey have HTML and CSS with the ocasional JS for the website. We will need to pull databases from other sites to merge the data together. We are not sure yet how to get those databases or where to store it.</small>

# 6. Next Steps
## <small>Diego will work on getting the files sent to everyone so we can all work on the same page so no work is lost or hard to inegrate. Along with making sure we all have the correct software to code together. Braydon will work on a way to get the data from other websites. Diego D will start the simple design structure of how the website will look like, along with tyler. They will come up with a simple overall design. Mitchelle will see which sports we should do and the other ones we shouldn't, dependign on what is available. </small>
