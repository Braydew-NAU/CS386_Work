# 2. Retrospective

## 1. Appreciations: <small>Braydon took the lead for deliverable 3 and copy over the correct structure for it and maintained it within the Github as well.</small>
## 2. Successes: <small>We fully got deliverable 3 finished and did everything right this time. We had to make up for everything we did wrong in deliverable 2, so we fixed that and did deliverable 3 perfectly.  </small>
## 3. Failures: <small>Not much as a failure this week except for minimal code set backs. We started to code and ran into a few issues as mentioned in the GIthub, or the features we wanted to implement.  </small>
## 4. Barriers:<small> This weeks barriers were one we have always had, two of our members could not do work over the weekend due to their busy schedules. This put a time limit on when we could do more work.</small>
## 5. What we should try next time:<small> Next time we will start to code while we are meeting during our weekly meeting as to not collide or run into furhter issues compared to when we do code seperately. </small>

# 3. Next Steps

## Mitchelle:
- Mitchelle will continue to add more psuedocode. He added a good amount to our skeloton and will continue to keep an outline for others to code using some of the models we used in class.   
## Diego A
- Diego will start to go into more depth for the basis that Braydon gives in the website code. He will add specifics and make sure the details are useful as we go on in the coding process.   
## Braydon
-  Braydon added a good basis amount of code and will continue to do so for more parts of the code and not go into much detail but will have a basis.   
## Diego D
- Diego will add more user cases which he did for this week, but now he will give the team a way to implement these cases and stories into our website code wise.   
## Tyler
- Tyler will do the bolding and italicising for deliverable 3. He is making sure that all of the deliverable is up to date with the requirements needed.
