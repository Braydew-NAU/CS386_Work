# 1. Activity Summary 
## Mitchelle:
- Mitchelle and Braydon worked on adding more to the bareones of the website. Mitchelle did the more skeleton of the website. 
## Diego A
- Diego brought some ideas on how we can split the work up both on each team members experience and their knowledge of the sports world. Each team member has a prefered sport that they each know a good amount on. This will be advantagous to bringing the content needed for all sports.  
## Braydon
- Braydon worked on the flow of how the website will look. Not so much content but more on how the style of the website will work. 
## Diego D
- Diego got more feedback on each sport, based on talking with the members, on what each fan base would like to see on the app. Each sport had very similar wants and similar negative things to say about the current market options. 
## Tyler
-  Tyler made sure we finsihed all of last weeks deliverables and got us as much progress for this weeks deliverables as well. 


# 2. Retrospective

## 1. Appreciations: <small>Diego D did a great job with the feedback that we can use to be better for our audience compared to the competitors that are out there right now. He was able to pin point some of the bigger issues with other sites that we can fix.</small>
## 2. Successes: <small>We got more code done this week and the entire backbone of our website is coming around. We are still working on the entirety of the workflow but it is coming along.</small>
## 3. Failures: <small>We didn't fully complete the deliverables we had set, buit we are very close to finishing it soon. This means were a bit behind with the deliverables but it is getting back to be on pace.</small>
## 4. Barriers:<small> This week was a very busy week for a majority of our group which means we had to meet very briefly before and after class. This made it hard for the progress we inteded to have come true, though a lot of work was completed.  </small>
## 5. What we should try next time:<small> Next time we will dedicate a time during the week where we can all work on a goal together. Either that, or we can split some of the work and get a lot of work done during that time and reflect on it later on the week. </small>

# 3. Next Steps

## Mitchelle:
- Mitchelle will get the feedback from Diego D and try to see what can be made for each sport in the website. 
## Diego A
- Diego will implement what we learned in the previous week from lecture and try to make the progress more efficent from the techniques learned. 
## Braydon
-  Braydon had a breakthrough with the data bases and will try to see how to implement that into the website, even if its something small, or a trail run
## Diego D
- Diego will start to narrow down the sports we want to show for the movies and which ones are displayed on the game section on the website. This will then feed into Tyler's next week job.
## Tyler
- Tyler will give us a design on how the movies are displayed along with the descriptions. Basically a way to display the website and how each piece will show on the website.
