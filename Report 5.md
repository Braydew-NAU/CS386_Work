# 1. Activity Summary 
## Mitchelle:

## Diego A

## Braydon
- Braydon maintained a good software architecture in the GitHub repo.
## Diego D
- Diego made sure our psuedocode was using the MVP model on our website. He looked and made sure we were doing what needed to. 
## Tyler
-  Tlyer reviewed functions of other sports websites to compare what and how they use them.


# 2. Retrospective

## 1. Appreciations: <small>Tyler gathered more data that we can use to our website. We don't have much code since we have been honing in on exactly what we want our website to look like, which is what all this data is going to do.</small>
## 2. Successes: <small>We have our Github fully up to date and should be ready to start making big progress towards the website code wise. </small>
## 3. Failures: <small>There wasn't much progress besides the data we gathered and making sure everything was organized and in order. Not much code written yet. </small>
## 4. Barriers:<small> This week's barries is one that we continue to have constantly and that is the lack of time. We all have a lot of things to do and not a lot of time to commit to the website each week. </small>
## 5. What we should try next time:<small> Next time I think we will try to get some code down during class since this is usually the only time we have during the week. This could be helpful to start building on the website instead of having so much data.  </small>

# 3. Next Steps

## Mitchelle:
- Mitchelle will write psuedo code for the basics of our website. He will see the skeleton thatm was implemented and start to add more pseudo so that we can continue to add.  
## Diego A
- Diego will start to code the basics of the website. He will go based off Mitchelle and Braydon will keep the code in check.  
## Braydon
-  Braydon will work on maintaining the architecture in Github and continue adding to it as mitchelle adds the psuedo.  
## Diego D
- Diego will look at the repo and see if any of our issues, use cases, or user stories are inaccurate and how we can make sure everything is up to date.  
## Tyler
- Tyler will use his data that he got from other websites and see if we can implement the best ones into our website, or at least have it in psuedocode.
