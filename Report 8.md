# 2. Retrospective

## 1. Appreciations: <small>This week the entire team did really good to each do their parts and build up the website. This week gave us a lot of progress forward and the website looks great.</small>
## 2. Successes: <small>The entire group's effort made the website grow a lot more and it looks a lot better. All that is missing is a few touch ups for aesthetics.</small>
## 3. Failures: <small>There weren't any big failures for this week that completely set us back or defined us. Not much to say as a failure for this week.</small>
## 4. Barriers:<small> Some barries were getting everyones code in the same spot and making sure that it worked with each others code. We needed to make sure that all 5 of our pieces of codes, intergrated seamlessly.</small>
## 5. What we should try next time:<small>Next time we will try to do our work at the same time so that there isn't as much hiccups in the communications we ahd while coding at different times. </small>

# 3. Next Steps

## Mitchelle:
- Mitchelle will continue to hone in on the search feature and make sure that it works flawlessly, even with a "no search found" message if a movie isn't in our database. 
## Diego A 
- Diego will continue to make the review feature look better since it is very basic as of now. He will make sure it looks pleaseing and fits the looks of the website. 
## Braydon
-  Braydon will try to see if there is a new way to get the csv file uploaded so it is not hardcoded. Though this will require for us to pay to host the file.     
## Diego D
- Diego will make sure that the title, description, and rating is all accurate for the movies based off the database that we pulled the movies from.    
## Tyler
- Tyler will make sure that the filter feature is working perfectly and even giving related searhces just in case that the movie is not found.
