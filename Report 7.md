# 2. Retrospective

## 1. Appreciations: <small>This week was a big team win as everyone did a lot of work all around to make sure that the midterm and presentation was done correctly and on time. </small>
## 2. Successes: <small>We got everything done that was on our lists, we got the presentation, the deliverable, and more code done for this week.  </small>
## 3. Failures: <small>There wasn't anything we could say a failure, small bumps here and there but other than that nothing too large to count as a failure. </small>
## 4. Barriers:<small> The barries were getting everyones work to be seamless with each others work. We mostly did the work as individuals then brought it together to make everything we needed, which was probably the most difficult.</small>
## 5. What we should try next time:<small>We now have a good amount of time to focus purley on our code and not have to worry so much about a midterm or presentation, plus everyone will be coming off a weeks worth break.</small>

- Mitchelle will start to finalize some of the psuedocode he has been implementing. This includes mainly polishing up the psuedo and making sure we have structure.
